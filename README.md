Trying 05_textgeneration.ipynb again in the newest huggingface transformers docker image which is running inside the container hfpt_Oct28.

Hmm interesting ... it now runs! With the 2070 Super! Nice!

Gonna also try the 06_summarization.ipynb again ... 

I had to run 'pip install py7zr'

1:49PM Wow ... so I renamed Data2/HuggingFace to Data2/HuggingFace_ then reran this notebook ... AND IT STILL RUNS! So where I thought the models were being saved to is wrong! ... Are they being saved into the container??
